## SOAP

Thought Process - 
Here we have to read the /etc/password file to get the flag. On running the instance I got web page. Here I first opened the web developer tools and then clicked on details option. There, I saw the content type written as XML,
which would mean that to perform the xxe injection attack which would give me all the passwords among which the flag would be there. On doing all that I finally got the flag 

FLAG --- picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_e5f02dbf}

## FORBIDDEN PATHS

Thought Process -  
Here they have given a website and on entering it we have to access the flag.txt file which is inside 4 directories as given.
So I just accessed the file by prepending the 4 directories and got the flag 

CODE ---
../../../../flag.txt 

FLAG --- picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5a6fcbc}

## cookies 

Thought Process - 
On accessing the website, we get a search box with an embedded word "snickerdoodle", on typing and searchng it we got the result "That is a cookie! Not very special though...". Now I opended the developer tools and under 
application bar I clicked on cookies to see that the value of snickerdoodle was 0. Now I Iterated through it by putting integer values starting from 1 to finally get the flag at values 18.

FLAG --- picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_94190c8a}
