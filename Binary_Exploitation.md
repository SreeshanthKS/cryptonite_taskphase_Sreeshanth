## FORMAT STRING 0

Thought Process - 
Here I just did wget to get the two given files and then played the program with the given detail and did trial and error 
and captured the flag 

FLAG ---
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_c8362f05}

## BUFFER OVERFLOW 0

Thought Process - 
So here they have given a source and program. I did wget to both of em. After that on viewing the code in vuln.c using "vi vuln.c", I found out that the prg was givin return values to those inputs which have less
16 characters in it. So If we were to overflow the input by exceeding the limit, the program would crash and we will get out flag 

FLAG---picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}

CODE ---
root@DESKTOP-DCDALLM:~# vi vuln.c
root@DESKTOP-DCDALLM:~# nc saturn.picoctf.net 60564
Input: flag
The program will exit now


okay
root@DESKTOP-DCDALLM:~# vi vuln.c
root@DESKTOP-DCDALLM:~# man gets
No manual entry for gets
root@DESKTOP-DCDALLM:~# nc saturn.picoctf.net 60564
Input: man gets
The program will exit now

f
root@DESKTOP-DCDALLM:~# nc saturn.picoctf.net 60564
Input: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}

## FLAG LEAK 

Thought Process - 
So here I ran the given source and then made it tell me the story in hex and then I started trying to find the flag in the hex characters that it gave by converting it using an hex converter and then I saw that the 
entire was flag was not told, then I saw the position of it and using that I made it say the hex characters from that position and then I saw that the flag was reversedin words, hence I reversed it again to get the flag

FLAG --- picoCTF{l34k1ng_Fl4g_0ff_St4ck_95f60617}
